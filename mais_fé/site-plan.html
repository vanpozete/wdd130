      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Our purpose is to help Content Creators to know how to approach the Gospel of Jesus Christ in social media channels. 
        My idea is to create a website for an upcoming event that discusses working with Gospel Topics in Social Media. The site will show the speaker’s profiles and the topic of their talks. The site 
        will also have a child page with a subscribed file for those attending on-site and another with all the information to attend online.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[Content Creators focused on christian content.
        The audience is everyone interested in knowing how to manage social media pages focused on religious topics.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
